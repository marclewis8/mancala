# mancala
Mancala problem set

whenever you do npm run pull for class content, youll need to reinstall pixi.js and @types/pixi.js --save-dev via npm install

Versions: Pixi.js 4.8.3 and types 4.8.8

To run tests: run npm run test mancala from the root directory

When testing, any onclicks made to student model should be made to ref model, since we can't directly modify scores we have to keep states consistent
